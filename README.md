## About *sCADView*
*sCADView* is a standalone, interactive, and reproducible Shiny and R-based tool to explore single-cell RNA-sequencing data of human coronary artery samples. Our goal is to make these valuable data analytic tools publicly available to non-bioinformaticians. This is an open-sourced tool that is freely available and can be modified for other scRNA-seq data. 

### Data Source
The data used in this interactive session were first published by Wirka et al. (Nature Medicine, 2019). The data were later extensively analyzed and made available here by Ma et al. (2021).

### Reproducibility and Code Availability 
*sCADView* is designed to be open-source and publicly available and serve as a template for other scRNA-seq analysis pipelines. The code scripts are available on our [GitHub Page](https://github.com/MillerLab-CPHG/sCADView). This application calls for .rds datafiles that are too large to host on Github, but you can find them [here](https://virginia.box.com/shared/static/oyo1bicpvlxen940zmciqapvg0y3n6gb.rds). To Run this application successfully, place the .rds object file in a folder/subdiretory called 'data.'
