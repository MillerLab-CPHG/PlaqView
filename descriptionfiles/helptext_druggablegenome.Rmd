### Use This Tab to Explore Drug-Gene Interactions

If you have a gene of interest, you can enter that gene to find known drugs or compounds that interact with it. A feature map of the gene of interest is also provided in your selected dataset. The drug interaction data is derived from [DGIDB.org](https://dgidb.org/) and made available through the [rDGIDB](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rDGIdb.html) package. In the future, CRISPR perturbation data will also be available. This is not for use in diagnosis or treatment in the clinical settle, only for scientific research.
