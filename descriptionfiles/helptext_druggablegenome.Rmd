### ***Druggable Genome Explorer***

Use this module to explore **potential drug targeting of specific cell types.**

If you have a gene of interest, you can enter that gene to find known drugs or compounds that interact with it. A feature map of the gene of interest is provided from your selected dataset. The drug interaction data is derived from [DGIDB.org](https://dgidb.org/) and made available through the [rDGIDB](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rDGIdb.html) package.

For details about each variables, click [here](https://www.dgidb.org/score). For details about interaction types, click [here](https://dgidb.org/interaction_types). For information about each databases and versions, click [here](https://dgidb.org/data_clients).
