#### **CIPR** provides a graphical representation of identity score of unknown or labeled cell clusters against known references.

This is an additional tool to help users further asset the quality of the current annotation or to further explore differential gene expressions.

We acknowledge and thank [Ekiz *et al.* (2020)](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-020-3538-2) for their publication and development of CIPR. By default, PlaqView will run CIPR with the **LogFC Dot Product Method** (LogFC values of the matching genes are mutliplied and added together to yield an aggregate identity score). **For details about CIPR, definitions, and references, please see their [website](https://github.com/atakanekiz/CIPR-Package "CIPR GitHub").**
