### Infer Cellular Communications

**Please be patient, calculations may take up to two minutes.**

**Flashing orange bar indicates calculation is still in progress!**

Use this module to explore upregulated communications pathways within the tissue. This is made possible by 'CellChat' ([Jin et al, 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21246-9)). CellChat uses the most up-to-date and manually curated database of ligand-receptor interactions. For details on the methods employed by CellChat, please refer to their original publication.
