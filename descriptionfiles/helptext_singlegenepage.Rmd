### PlaqView: an interactive portal to explore single cell RNA-seq of human coronary artery.

**Please be patient, it might take a while to query.** 

Use this module to explore gene expression of any gene in different human coronary artery cell populations

For a **single** gene, feature and ridge plots work well. For **multiple** genes, use dot plots.

*to save plot, right-click and 'save image as'", please cite Ma et al., (2021) and Wirka et al., (2019) in your publications*
