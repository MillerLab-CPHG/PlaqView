Use this module to **query specific gene(s) in the context of the raw metadata associated with the original dataset.** Please note: scRNA-seq metadata formatting has no common convention, and PlaqView may not be able to render completely. 

Gene names will be converted to correct format based on species. 

Acronyms: chondrocytes (CH) common myeloid progenitor (CMP), dendritic cells (DC), endothelial cells (EC), fibroblasts (FB), granulocyte/monocyte progenitors (GMP), Macrophages (MÃ¸), Monocytes (Mono), Natural Killer (NK), stem cells (SC), smooth muscle cells (SMC).
