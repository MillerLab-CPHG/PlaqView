### ***Metadata Explorer***

Use this module to **query specific gene(s) and metadata associated with the original dataset as well as PlaqView-generated metadata.**

Metadata formatting has no common convention, and PlaqView may not be able to render completely. 

Gene names will be converted to correct format based on species. For a **single** gene, feature and ridge plots work well. For **multiple** genes, use dot plots.

Acronyms: chondrocytes (CH) common myeloid progenitor (CMP), dendritic cells (DC), endothelial cells (EC), fibroblasts (FB), granulocyte/monocyte progenitors (GMP), Macrophages (MÃ¸), Monocytes (Mono), Natural Killer (NK), stem cells (SC), smooth muscle cells (SMC).
