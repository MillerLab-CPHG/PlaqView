### ***Metadata Explorer (experimental)***

Use this module to **query specific gene(s) in the context of the raw metadata associated with the original dataset.** Please note: scRNA-seq metadata formatting has no common convention, and PlaqView may not be able to render completely. Furthermore, some datasets may not have sufficient metadata for graphing, and will generate errors.

When available, Factor-Type metadata are generally categories like gender, sex, etc., whereas Continuous-Type metadata are generally quality control (QC) metrics. You can change how the QC metrics are displayed in relation to the Factor-Type metadata.

Acronyms: chondrocytes (CH) common myeloid progenitor (CMP), dendritic cells (DC), endothelial cells (EC), fibroblasts (FB), granulocyte/monocyte progenitors (GMP), Macrophages (MÃ¸), Monocytes (Mono), Natural Killer (NK), stem cells (SC), smooth muscle cells (SMC).

Common Metadata Annotations: nCount/nFeatures- [Seurat's internal metric](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html) for QC control. Prediction.scores- [SingleR's metric](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/SingleR/inst/doc/SingleR.html) for QC. For other abbreviations not listed, please refer to the original publication of the respective dataset for explanations.
