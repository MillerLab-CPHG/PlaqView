### **PlaqView**: an interactive application to explore scRNA-seq of human coronary artery.

**Please be patient, it might take a while to query.** 

Use this module to explore **multiple** genes' expression pattern. 'Feature Plot' and 'Feature Plot' will generate a UMAP for each gene you enter; 'Dot Plot' will generate one large graph that encompasses all of the queried genes.

If you encounter an error, make sure there is a space after each comma. e.g. NOX4, MYH11, CDH2.
