### **PlaqView**: an interactive application to explore scRNA-seq of human coronary artery.

Use this module to **compare different cell annotation techniques.** 

By default, *Plaqview* uses *SingleR* (Aran et al.), which uses reference-based algorithms to deduce cell identity of individual cells. Other tools, such as *scCATCH* (Shao et al.) can also annotate cell types without user-input. Alternatively, users can download differential gene expression lists created by *Seurat V4* (Satija Lab) and manually define cells by clusters. 

Note: *scCATCH* requires user-defined tissue type reference (e.g. Heart, Blood Vessels)
