### PlaqView: an interactive portal to explore single cell RNA-seq of human coronary artery.

**Please be patient, it might take a while to query.** 

Use this module to compare different cell annotation techniques. By default, *Plaqview* uses *SingleR* (Aran et al.), which uses reference-based algorithm to deduce cell identity of individual cells. Other tools, such as *scCATCH* (Shao et al.) can also annotate cell types without user-input. Alternatively, users can download differential gene expression lists created by *Seurat V4* (Satija Lab) and manually define cells by clusters. 

*to save plot, right-click and 'save image as'", please cite Ma et al., (2021) and Wirka et al., (2019) in your publications*
