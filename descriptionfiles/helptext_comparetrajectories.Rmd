### ***Trajectory Explorer***

Use this module to explore **RNA velocity and inferred cell differentiation paths.**

*Plaqview* uses *Monocle3* [(Trapnell Lab)](https://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle3/) for cell RNA trajectory inference. We found that *Monocle3* was the most flexible in handling complex datasets with multiple cell origins (as opposed to purified/cultured samples).

To further explore subsets of the data, use the right modules to select and re-cluster cells. **It may take up to 10mins** to recalculate depending on number of cells and complexity, please be patient.
