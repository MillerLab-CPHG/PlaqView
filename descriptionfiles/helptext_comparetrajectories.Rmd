### ***Trajectory Explorer***

*Plaqview* uses *Monocle3* [(Trapnell Lab)](https://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle3/) for cell RNA trajectory inference. We found that *Monocle3* was the most flexible in handling complex datasets with multiple cell origins (as opposed to purified/cultured samples).

To further explore subsets of the data, use the right modules to select and re-cluster cells. It may take a few moments to recalculate, please be patient.
