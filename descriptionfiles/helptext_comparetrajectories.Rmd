### PlaqView: an interactive portal to explore single cell RNA-seq of human coronary artery.

Use this module to **compare different RNA trajectory methods.** 

By default, *Plaqview* uses *Monocle3* (Trapnell Lab) for cell RNA trajectory inference. We found that *Monocle3* was the most flexible in handling complex datasets with multiple cell origins (as opposed to purified/cultured samples). 

Here, we can compare other popular trajectory methods in a subset of the Wirka et al. (2019) human coronary artery dataset. Because some of these methods, such as SCORPIUS and Slingshot, cannot handle cells in distinct clusters, we have pre-selected clusters here.
